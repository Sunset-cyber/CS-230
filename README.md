The Gaming room was a client with software requirements of creating a game application called Draw It
or Lose It which was a game that rendered 2D images over a set time and teams are able to take guesses
at what the final answer is.
In developing this documentation, I felt that I did a good job at analyzing the different Operating Systems
between Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, and Android OS.
I found it helpful to know the specifics of each operating system when developing the code so that I
could think about how best to develop the code in a way that performed optimally.
I felt that I could revise the design constraints portion to be more detailed.
When it came to the user's needs, I kept in mind their need for the application to run smoothly across 
a network with other players also connecting to the application. This was why I chose to use a serverless
architecture and opt into a cloud computing model because it has the lowest risk of downtime and allows
us to scale up if need be.
In the future, I would continue to take deep dives into what I believe my customer base is most likely to 
be and use that information to inform what operating system(s) I would prioritize development for, or if
taking a balanced approach is more appropriate.
